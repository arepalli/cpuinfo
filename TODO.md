# 0.0.1:
- [ ] Fix HardCoded values like processor count, keys count and Keys column width.


# Challenge:
- [x ] The task for this challenge is to read the Linux CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo and display it
using QML.
- [x ] The data visualization, including UI layout and design, is up to you—be creative!
- [x ] The solution must run on a standard Linux system, preferably Ubuntu, and should be written using Qt
C++ to read the system information and Qt Quick (not QWidget) to display the data. Qt version should
be at least Qt 5.4.
- [ ] Please provide some basic documentation on how to run your application, and document the project
assuming you are in a software development team where others need to enhance and extend your
project.
- [x ] It’s OK if you haven’t used Qt before, just make a note of this when you submit your solution.
